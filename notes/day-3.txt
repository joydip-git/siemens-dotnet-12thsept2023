polymorphism:
	compile-time/static:
		method overloading (constructor overloading)
		operator overloading
	run-time/dynamic:
		method overriding (virtul - with base and override with child)
		virtual -> override -> override

	
Equality:
	a. override Equals method of Object class
	b. overload == and != operator
	c. override GetHashCode method of Object class

Security =>
	a. Hashing => 
	b. encryption => 
	c. digital signature


	data => function <= seed (key)
				hash code

	data-block1 + random => function => 1st Hash Code
	data-block2 + 1st Hash Code => function => 2nd Hash Code
	..........................................................
	data-block100 + 99th hash code => function => 100th Hash Code
