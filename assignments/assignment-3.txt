create a C# application to calculate salary of any employee, where employees are of two types: Hr and Developer

name: PayrollApp

class#1:
Hr entity structure:
	attributes: name, id, basic payment, da payment, hra payment, gratuity payment
	functionalities: 
		name: 		calculateSalary [b+d+h+g]
		argumnets: 	none
		return type: 	double

class#2:
Developer entity structure:
	attributes: name, id, basic payment, da payment, hra payment, incentive payment
	functionalities: 
		name: 		calculateSalary [b+d+h+i]
		argumnets: 	none
		return type: 	double
UI:
	a. ask user how many employee instances/records to be created
	b. create that many employee instances (accept all the attribute values from user)
		i. print menu for user so that user can choose which type of object to be created
		ii. based on the choice you create that type of employee object
	c. save every instance of employee in an array
	d. iterate through the array and calculate salary of every instance and print the same

Note: 
*: the class containing main method should be part of a console applicaion and the classes for employee types should be present in a library application
**: every data member must have property (getter and setter).
***: the class must have default and parameterized constructor
